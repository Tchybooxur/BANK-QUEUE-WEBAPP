# BANK-QUEUE-WEBAPP
### A simple web application in c# that illustrates the basic workings of a queue data structure.

Take a sneak peak below:

This code-along project was embarked on when I was being introduced to C# via pragim technologies tutorial videos.
The app is easy to operate. You run the code, you print tokens and issue them to customers at the bank. The customers are then assigned to
the different counters based on their token numbers in a FIFO (First In First Out) format. The first person on the queue is the first person
to be assigned to a counter. Next would be the person after him etc. The assignment is done on a first come first serve basis.
